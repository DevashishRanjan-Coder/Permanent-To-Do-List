# Permalist

Permalist is a portmanteau of permanent + to-do list.
This project is a permanent to-do list with data persistence.
All the data is stored in a PostgresSQL database.
I am connecting to the db using the pg middleware.

The logic is in js, styling is in CSS, templating engine is EJS and queries are written using SQL.
